# Task 1: Grocery Store Math Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, 
# given their individual prices. For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? 
# Prices don't need to be realistic


bread_price = 23
peanut_butter_price = 33
jelly_price = 43

total_cost = (bread_price + peanut_butter_price + jelly_price)

print (total_cost)



# Task 2: Bank Interest (Extra Credit) If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a 
# fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year. 
# So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. 
# For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.

initial_amount = 10000
interest_rate = 0.07
total_amount = initial_amount * (1+interest_rate)

print (total_amount)
