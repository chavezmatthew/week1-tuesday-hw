# Task 1: Validating Calculations Calculate the value of a particular arithmetic expression twice: 
# once normally, and once using parentheses. Compare the two results to see if they match.

five_plus_four = 5+4
five_plus_four_parens = (5+4)

print (five_plus_four)
print (five_plus_four_parens)


# Task 2: Mix and Match Combine arithmetic (+), logical (or), and comparison (>) operators in a 
# single expression and predict the outcome. Then, compute the expression to see if the prediction was correct.


mix_match = (5+4) > 3 or (6+9) > 3
#true

print (mix_match)
